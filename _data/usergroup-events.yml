In the time it took you to pull up the description of this conference, perhaps on your phone, tablet or laptop, you have already considered the conference location, investigated the good eats and conference events, and mapped all of your indoor and outside activities. URISA connects members and partners with the educational, networking and collaboration resources that professionals need to evolve geospatial tools and solutions that respond to real places in real time. Join the GIS Community in Toronto, Ontario for a powerful, collective exchange of GIS knowledge! Note: If you get a phone call from someone claiming to be from the Westin Harbour Castle saying that there is now a cheaper rate... just hang up. It is a scam. URISA's Event page"
