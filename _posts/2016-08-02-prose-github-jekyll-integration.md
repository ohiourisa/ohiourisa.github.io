This post was written with the [Prose](http://prose.io) online editor. Prose connects with your GitHub account, allowing static [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) sites to be edited online. Even better, posts can be written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). As a bonus, Prose offers a handy toolbar, giving you Markdown shortcuts such as:
 - lists
 
**bold**, _italics_, [links](#) and even images.

Prose is open source and can be installed on your own server or you can use the hosted service at [http://prose.io](http://prose.io).
